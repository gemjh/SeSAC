Today we're going on a deep dive. Oh, a deep dive. Into the world of art collecting in early 18th century Paris. Sounds fascinating. Yeah. It's really interesting stuff. And we've got some pretty cool academic book reviews to help us along. Book reviews. Yeah. We're going to be looking at a couple of book reviews that kind of dig into. Okay. Just how much more was going on with art collecting than then just like buying pretty pictures. Right. It's serious intrigue. We're talking ideologies, rivalries, and even a little taste of battle of the sexes. The battle of the sexes in the art world. The better believe it. Wow. It's amazing to me how these just straightforward acts of like acquiring art. Right. Can actually reflect these like much larger cultural and political tensions that are kind of bubbling beneath the surface of Parisian society. Absolutely. So let's meet our key players. Okay. Here, Crisot, a man who clearly knew how to make a statement with his collection and the contest of a room. The contest of a room. Who curated a collection that is as vibrant and dynamic as the era itself. Their rivalry wasn't just about like personal preference. It was like this clash of world views. Oh, wow. Really mirroring the famous quarrel of the ancients and the modern. Oh, interesting. So Crisot with his Italian masters classical bronzes. He really embodied the ancients. He was championing those like established artistic traditions. Yeah. So he's... And Veru on the other hand, she embraced the modern. Okay. And she did that with her collection of Flamish Dutch and contemporary French works. Oh, wow. The playful genre scenes and landscapes that really captured like the spirit of the new century. So it's like each piece of art was like a declaration of allegiance in this intellectual tug of war. A tug of war, absolutely. I'm picturing these like lavish salons. Right, yeah. Buzzing with debate just as much as they're buzzing with like admiration for the art itself. Exactly. And the way they display their collections really amplified those statements as well. I bet. Crisot's mansion was designed to overwhelm visitors with the sheer scale and grandeur of his collection. Yeah. I think high ceilings or Nate frames. Right. And a sense of almost like museum like serious. Yes. Yeah. Veru's home, however, was designed for like a more intimate experience. Okay. A space for like conversation. Oh. A contemplation. Interesting. Where the art like invited close to inspection and it's worth lively discussion. So that's a really interesting contrast. Yeah. The tell me it was Crozat just like trying to show off his wealth or was there like something deeper going on. I mean, he actually hoped to sell his collection to the crown, right? That's right. And in early 18th century Paris, you know, selling your collection to the crown wasn't simply a financial transaction. Of course not. This is path to social immortality. Wow. I mean, it meant that your collection, your taste, your name would be forever linked with the highest power in the land. Right. So Crosot as someone who had built his fortune rather than inherited it, really craved that kind of lasting legitimacy. So in a way, his art collection was like a carefully curated stepping stone to a higher social echelon. Absolutely. It makes you wonder if his taste was like genuinely his own or influenced by what he thought would impress the court. Right. But what about Veru? Well, Veru was she above such social climbing? She's certainly cultivated this image of effortless elegance and connoisseur ship. Right. But it wasn't just about aesthetics. Okay. Her collecting practice is also challenged. That prevailing notion of women's role in the art world. How interesting. She championed this idea of Goot natural. Goot natural. Goot natural. Okay. A natural good taste. Okay. And here into women. Central for cultivating polyteses. A litesque. That perfect blend of manners and social grace that defined elite society. So she wasn't just collecting art. She was like making a statement about women's influence. That's a nice mix. That's pretty bold for the time. Absolutely. Her circle rejected what they saw as the overly intellectual, almost pedantic approach of Crosot in his group. Got it. They believed that true taste was about more than just knowledge and scholarship. Right. It was about intuition feeling. Okay. And a certain feminine sensibility. Interesting. This tension actually foreshadows. Really. Later critiques of the Rococo style, which was often dismissed as excessively feminine. Oh, wow. And frivolous. So these art rivalries were actually, skirmishes in like a much larger cultural battle over absolute taste, gender roles and the very definition of beauty itself. Exactly. And sisk in the author of sheltering art takes it even further. Okay. Framing the rivalry in class terms. Oh. So Veru with her aristocratic lineage. And supposedly embodied a more refined inherent understanding of beauty. Okay. Crosot, the bourgeois upstart. Uh-huh. We'll see an as striving for legitimacy through acquisition. It's so fascinating how she paints Crosot as this arrevest, right, desperately trying to buy his way into acceptance. Yeah. But is that really the whole story? I mean, that the term bourgeois gets thrown around a lot. Right. Often lumping together vastly different social groups. Right. So true circle truly. Right. So exclusive. You're right to be skeptical of those neat categories. Yeah. Take the Marquis Dupri. Okay. A key member of a Ru circle. Okay. Her father was a military supplier and finance here. Okay. Definitely new money. And then there's Jean Baptiste, Glicta Samport. Okay. Whose father, a Dutch immigrant, made his fortune in textiles. Okay. So these were ambitious individuals, climbing the social ladder through a mix of talent connections. And yes, Saviour collecting. So while there were definitely like class dynamics at play, right, these circles were clearly more complex than a simple, a aristocrats versus everyone else. Exhausted. Sounds like blinds between old money and new money were starting to blur. Yeah. And art collecting was a way to kind of navigate that shifting landscape. Absolutely. And is that where Jean Baptiste's PLA-Bruin enters the picture? That's right. He's the guy who really shook things up in the... He did. Parisian art market, right? That's right. He was a dealer auctioneer who really blurred those lines between art merchant and connoisseur and his innovative strategies. Yeah. Totally transformed the way people bought and sold art. So how did LeBron go about changing the game? Was he like this flamboyant auctioneer charming his way into... What? Bigger sales. A brinan was known for a different kind of strategy. Okay. Radical transparency. In a time when connoisseurs like guarded information. Yeah. Like it was street secrets giving them a real edge in the art market. Right. LeBron believed that knowledge should be shared. Okay. Empowering buyers to make informed decisions. That's a pretty revolutionary concept for the 18th century. He was. It's like he was democratizing. He was the art world. On a way. In a way, but how did he actually like put that into practice? Well he published extensive research on artists. Okay. Curiously documenting their styles, techniques, and influences. Wow. He even invented the catalog, Reason A. The catalog, Reason A. Yes. A comprehensive, annotated catalog. Okay. Of an artist's entire body of work. Imagine the level of scholarship that went into creating those catalogs. Like it's incredible. It sounds like he was not only a savvy businessman, but a true scholar of art. He must have ruffled some feathers. Oh yeah. Among the established connoisseurs. But they just like accept this sudden influx of information or... LeBron's approach was a direct challenge to their authority. Okay. But he didn't stop there. No. He also started publishing the provenences of paintings. Yeah. Essentially their ownership histories. Oh wow. Revealing who would own a piece and for how long? That's interesting. And get this. Okay. He even included past prices of paintings. What? In his auction catalogs. That's incredible. Game changer. Like that. Suddenly buyers had access to information that was previously... Right. Only whispered among them. I'm a select few. Exactly. They could compare prices. Right. Trace the history of a work and make more informed decisions about what they were willing to pay. Wow. This new level of transparency really helped to create a more level playing field. Challenging those traditional power dynamics of the art market. It sounds like he was single-handedly disrupting... That's the art world establishment. But was he successful? Well, did his strategy actually translate into bigger sales? The broom stayed in business for four decades. Playing a pivotal role in shaping the Parisian art market. Wow. While a comprehensive index of option prices... Right. From that time doesn't exist. Right. We do have some tantalizing clues. Okay. For instance. Records from the 1784 sale of the Contavaadroys collection. Okay. Which LeBren himself helped to assemble. Show that... Netherlandish paintings. Right. The kind of works LeBren champion. Yeah. Dominated the sale. Okay. Generating a whopping 76% of the total revenue. So he was clearly attuned to the tastes of the market. And knew how to present those works in a way that generated... Excitement and competition. That competition. He had his finger on the pulse of what buyers we're looking for. He really did. But was he also shaping those tastes? I mean, we were talking really about the rise of new money. Right. And the blurring of social lines? Right. What was LeBren influencing those trends as well? Well, LeBren had this knack for anticipating future trends. Okay. He was a champion of emerging artists. Okay. Actively promoting their work and creating a buzz... Oh yeah. Around the next generation of talent. Right. He even provided gallery space for the exposition de la gentesse. Me exposition de la gentesse. During the French Revolution. Okay. Traditionally an outdoor exhibition for young artists. That's a brilliant move. That was. Not only was he providing these young artists with like... Right. Much needed exposure during a time of a people. Exactly. But he was also like positioning himself as a visionary. Someone who was investing in the future of art. Exactly. It was a savvy business move. It was. And a statement about his commitment to fostering the next generation of artists. Right. He understood that the art market was constantly evolving. And to stay ahead of the curve, you needed to be adaptable, willing to take risks. Right. And always on the lookout for what was new and exciting. He sounds like the art world equivalent. He does. Like a venture capitalist. Yeah. Betting on the talent of the future. He was. It makes me wonder, did LeBren's approach change the relationship between dealers and connoisseurs? It's possible. I mean, traditionally there's been like a certain tension there. Yes. With connoisseurs seeing themselves as the guardians of taste. Mm. And dealers often viewed with suspicion. Yeah. More interested in profit than art. Right. That's an insightful observation. Yeah. LeBren's approach definitely challenged. Okay. That traditional binary. So instead of viewing dealers and connoisseurs as adversaries. Right. He saw them as potential collaborators. Yes. Each with their own expertise and insights to contribute. Exactly. That raises a really important question. Yeah. Did LeBren's efforts to promote transparency and knowledge sharing? Mm. Ultimately create a more equitable art market. Mm. Or did they simply shift the balance of power, right, creating new forms of inequality? That's a complex issue with no easy answers. Of course. On the one hand, he democratized access to information. Right. Empowering buyers. Yeah. And challenging that exclusive hold connoisseurs once had. Mm. On knowledge. Right. But on the other hand, you can argue that this shift Yeah. Created new hierarchies with dealers like LeBren. Right. Who controlled the flow of information Right. to becoming the new power brokers. Yeah. It's a debate that continues to this day. It's fascinating to think how LeBren's strategies might have influenced art collecting practices. Yeah. Even today. I think they have. I mean, auctions at Sotheby's and Christie's still operate with a degree of transparency that LeBren would probably Right. Proof of. I think so. They guarantee the authenticity of the works they sell. Mm. Provide detailed information about provenance and allow potential buyers to examine the pieces before bidding. But there's still this element of secrecy, especially when it comes to reserve prices. Yeah. And the identities of the buyers, which suggests that some aspects of the art market remain shrouded in mystery. And the information still valuable commodity. Well, he will come out of the game. Exactly. LeBren's vision of a completely transparent art market. Yeah. Where everyone has equal access to knowledge. Right. Remains elusive. But his legacy lives on in the way we think about art. I think it's both an aesthetic and a financial asset. It does. And in like the ongoing quest for a more inclusive and equitable art world. Absolutely. His story reminds us that the art world is more than just a collection of pretty pictures. Right. It's a dynamic ecosystem for money, taste, and ideas collide. It's true. And where the choices we make as collectors, yeah. really reflect our values and our understanding of the world. So what does all this mean for us today? You know, as we navigate the art world, it can be pretty intimidating, right? And it can be, yeah. Especially with all the, especially with the hype, the big names, you know, it's the sky high prices. It's true. It can seem like this really exclusive club with its own like secret language and ritual. Right. And how do we break into that? Well, I think LeBruhn's story. Mmm. Really reminds us that knowledge is power. It is. So before we even think about bidding at an auction or visiting a gallery or something, we should really do our homework. Do your research. Yeah. Research. The artists understand their styles influences delve into like the provenance of a piece. It's almost like detective work. Yeah. Uncovering the hidden stories behind each brush stroke. And love that. Yeah. And don't be afraid to challenge the status quo. Right. Just because something is exactly expensive or endorsed by a famous critic. So it's making good art. Right. Exactly. Trust your own instincts. Absolutely. Develop your own taste and be open to discovering artists who are really like, Hmm. Pushing the boundaries and challenging conventions. Those are the exciting ones. Yeah. That's a great reminder. It's so easy to get swept away by trends and market hype. But ultimately, art collecting should be about personal connection and a genuine appreciation for beauty. Absolutely. Whatever form that takes. I agree. Yeah. And remember, every acquisition is more than just a transaction. It's like a statement about a statement. What you value how you see the world. Where you fit within the grand tapestry of art history. Art history. Yeah. Wow. So as you embark on your own. Yeah. Art collecting journey, whether you're a seasoned connoisseur, more just starting out. Yeah. Embrace that spirit of curiosity. Be curious. Be a discerning detective. Yes. And don't be afraid to forge your own path. For your own path, absolutely. And who knows, you might just discover the next overlooked masterpiece or champion, the next artistic innovator. That would be amazing. Just like LeBron did centuries ago. That's right. Well, thanks for joining us for this deep dive into the world of 18th century Paris. It was my pleasure. We hope you've gained a new appreciation for the... I hope so. Complexity is of art collecting and the enduring influence of those who dared to challenge the status quo. Absolutely. We'll see you next time. See you next time. For another fascinating exploration.

Today we're going on a deep dive. Oh, a deep dive. Into the world of art collecting in early 18th century Paris. Sounds fascinating. Yeah. It's really interesting stuff. And we've got some pretty cool academic book reviews to help us along. Book reviews. Yeah. We're going to be looking at a couple of book reviews that kind of dig into. Okay. Just how much more was going on with art collecting than then just like buying pretty pictures. Right. It's serious intrigue. We're talking ideologies, rivalries, and even a little taste of battle of the sexes. The battle of the sexes in the art world. The better believe it. Wow. It's amazing to me how these just straightforward acts of like acquiring art. Right. Can actually reflect these like much larger cultural and political tensions that are kind of bubbling beneath the surface of Parisian society. Absolutely. So let's meet our key players. Okay. Here, Crisot, a man who clearly knew how to make a statement with his collection and the contest of a room. The contest of a room. Who curated a collection that is as vibrant and dynamic as the era itself. Their rivalry wasn't just about like personal preference. It was like this clash of world views. Oh, wow. Really mirroring the famous quarrel of the ancients and the modern. Oh, interesting. So Crisot with his Italian masters classical bronzes. He really embodied the ancients. He was championing those like established artistic traditions. Yeah. So he's... And Veru on the other hand, she embraced the modern. Okay. And she did that with her collection of Flamish Dutch and contemporary French works. Oh, wow. The playful genre scenes and landscapes that really captured like the spirit of the new century. So it's like each piece of art was like a declaration of allegiance in this intellectual tug of war. A tug of war, absolutely. I'm picturing these like lavish salons. Right, yeah. Buzzing with debate just as much as they're buzzing with like admiration for the art itself. Exactly. And the way they display their collections really amplified those statements as well. I bet. Crisot's mansion was designed to overwhelm visitors with the sheer scale and grandeur of his collection. Yeah. I think high ceilings or Nate frames. Right. And a sense of almost like museum like serious. Yes. Yeah. Veru's home, however, was designed for like a more intimate experience. Okay. A space for like conversation. Oh. A contemplation. Interesting. Where the art like invited close to inspection and it's worth lively discussion. So that's a really interesting contrast. Yeah. The tell me it was Crozat just like trying to show off his wealth or was there like something deeper going on. I mean, he actually hoped to sell his collection to the crown, right? That's right. And in early 18th century Paris, you know, selling your collection to the crown wasn't simply a financial transaction. Of course not. This is path to social immortality. Wow. I mean, it meant that your collection, your taste, your name would be forever linked with the highest power in the land. Right. So Crosot as someone who had built his fortune rather than inherited it, really craved that kind of lasting legitimacy. So in a way, his art collection was like a carefully curated stepping stone to a higher social echelon. Absolutely. It makes you wonder if his taste was like genuinely his own or influenced by what he thought would impress the court. Right. But what about Veru? Well, Veru was she above such social climbing? She's certainly cultivated this image of effortless elegance and connoisseur ship. Right. But it wasn't just about aesthetics. Okay. Her collecting practice is also challenged. That prevailing notion of women's role in the art world. How interesting. She championed this idea of Goot natural. Goot natural. Goot natural. Okay. A natural good taste. Okay. And here into women. Central for cultivating polyteses. A litesque. That perfect blend of manners and social grace that defined elite society. So she wasn't just collecting art. She was like making a statement about women's influence. That's a nice mix. That's pretty bold for the time. Absolutely. Her circle rejected what they saw as the overly intellectual, almost pedantic approach of Crosot in his group. Got it. They believed that true taste was about more than just knowledge and scholarship. Right. It was about intuition feeling. Okay. And a certain feminine sensibility. Interesting. This tension actually foreshadows. Really. Later critiques of the Rococo style, which was often dismissed as excessively feminine. Oh, wow. And frivolous. So these art rivalries were actually, skirmishes in like a much larger cultural battle over absolute taste, gender roles and the very definition of beauty itself. Exactly. And sisk in the author of sheltering art takes it even further. Okay. Framing the rivalry in class terms. Oh. So Veru with her aristocratic lineage. And supposedly embodied a more refined inherent understanding of beauty. Okay. Crosot, the bourgeois upstart. Uh-huh. We'll see an as striving for legitimacy through acquisition. It's so fascinating how she paints Crosot as this arrevest, right, desperately trying to buy his way into acceptance. Yeah. But is that really the whole story? I mean, that the term bourgeois gets thrown around a lot. Right. Often lumping together vastly different social groups. Right. So true circle truly. Right. So exclusive. You're right to be skeptical of those neat categories. Yeah. Take the Marquis Dupri. Okay. A key member of a Ru circle. Okay. Her father was a military supplier and finance here. Okay. Definitely new money. And then there's Jean Baptiste, Glicta Samport. Okay. Whose father, a Dutch immigrant, made his fortune in textiles. Okay. So these were ambitious individuals, climbing the social ladder through a mix of talent connections. And yes, Saviour collecting. So while there were definitely like class dynamics at play, right, these circles were clearly more complex than a simple, a aristocrats versus everyone else. Exhausted. Sounds like blinds between old money and new money were starting to blur. Yeah. And art collecting was a way to kind of navigate that shifting landscape. Absolutely. And is that where Jean Baptiste's PLA-Bruin enters the picture? That's right. He's the guy who really shook things up in the... He did. Parisian art market, right? That's right.
